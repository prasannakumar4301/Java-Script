                              0       1       2           n-1


            variableName[index] = value;


            variableName[index]

Object: Collection of key-value pairs.

    Syntax:

        var variableName = {
            key1: value1,
            key2: value2,
            key3: value3,


            keyN: valueN
        };

        variableName[key];

        variableName[key] = value;
