Arithmetic Operators:
+ - Addition
- - Subtraction
* - Multiplication
/ - Division
% - Modulus
++ - Increment (It takes current value as an input and increments the value by 1)
-- - Decrement (It takes current value as an input and decrements the value by 1)

Syntax:

    variableName++ (variableName = variableName + 1)

    variableName-- (variableName = variableName - 1)

    It takes value present in variableName, adds the variableName value with 1. Later it updates the value of the variableName.

Assignment Operators (Shorthand Operators):
= - Assigns right side value to the left side variable
+= - a += b // a = a + b
-= - a -= b // a = a - b
*= - a *= b // a = a * b
/= - a /= b // a = a / b
%= - a %= b // a = a % b

Comparison Operators
== - Double equal to
=== - Triple equal to
!= - Not equal
!== - Not Double equal
> - Greater than
< - Less than
>= - Greater than or equal to 
<= - Less than or equal to
? - ternary

    Syntax:

        condition ? true statement : false statement

Logical Operators
&& - Logical AND - If all the conditions are true, it returns true.
|| - Logical OR - If any of the condition is true, it returns true.
! - Logical Not - If current value is true, it returns false.
